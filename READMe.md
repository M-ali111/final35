Hello!
This project maybe not that good enough, but i spent two days on it
So, i used mongodb connection with 2 databases "Hello" and "FinalW", fist one for user authorization, and second for CRUD
In package.json you can dependencies see of this project
I used multer for uploading images in CRUD
Also i used bcrypt for hashing my passwords, but it's not that necessary
I thied to implement nodemailer for sending mails on email, but i got some issues
Other parts is usual, i think
See on defending!
